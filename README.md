## What is BCR-GUI

BCR-GUI is a call recordings manager app, started as _companion app_ for the great [BCR](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/BCR) (Basic Call Recorder) Android application and grown up to support many other call recorders:

- [BCR - Basic Call Recorder](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/BCR)
- [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) Call Recorder (see [here](https://github.com/nicorac/bcr-gui/issues/30))
- [ColorOS](https://www.oppo.com/en/coloros12/) Call Recorder (see [here](https://github.com/nicorac/bcr-gui/issues/100))
- Huawei Call Recorder (see [here](https://github.com/nicorac/bcr-gui/issues/44))
- [LineageOS](https://lineageos.org/) Call Recorder (see [here](https://github.com/nicorac/bcr-gui/issues/121))

To manage BCR (and other call recorders) recordings, you actually need to use a file manager... and that's not so user-friendly ðŸ˜‰.
It's hard to "extract" call informations from audio filename, and it's even harder to search them when the list grows.

Such a feature was [already requested](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/BCR/issues/135#issuecomment-1642889831), but **chenxiaolong** (the author of BCR) wants to keep BCR **Basic**; and I do agree with him! Call recording on Android is a hard work, and I'd like (and hope) him to stay focused on it... recordings management is a job made for BCR-GUI ðŸ˜‚. Other call recorders never had one.

## Requirements

If used with BCR, BCR-GUI needs **BCR v.1.49** (or newer) to work at its best; that version features the new [JSON call metadata file](https://github.com/chenxiaolong/BCR/issues/380), used by BCR-GUI to read detailed call info and show them in its call list. In case of missing JSON file (eg. recordings done before 1.49 or when using **another** recording app), BCR-GUI will try to extract call data from recording filename. You can customize the format of the filename being parsed.

## Permissions

- **BCR-GUI does not need root access** to work. \
  It only needs **READ** access to the directory used by BCR to save recordings. At the first start, it asks you to select your recordings directory (using the well-known [Android SAF](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/shared/documents-files) dialogs) and allow read access to it.

- It **does not need Internet access** at all. \
  _NOTE:_ this may change in the future if an auto-update feature will be added, but actually the app can't send/receive anything to/from internet.

- _(optional)_ It needs **Contacts** permission to update recordings names with contacts or create new contacts for recordings from unknown callers. Feel free to **deny** the permission: app will remember you how to enable it the next time you use a feature requiring it.

## What's working/missing?

BCR-GUI is stable and ready for usage!

Working:

- **list**: show an ordered list of your call recordings
- **play**: play each call recording straight from the list (no external player needed)
- **share**: share recording file with other apps, like messaging, email, ...
- **delete**: delete recordings
- **manual edit**: edit caller name
- **create contact**: create a new contact with recording phone number \
  (to be used after recording a call from an unknown contact)
- **search number**: search an existing contact with recording phone number** \
  (to be used if you've already created the contact after recording the call)

Still missing (not ready yet...):

- **edit**: allow user to add **own** data to call recording, like notes, tags, ...
- **filter**: be able to filter list by tags, content, date range, length, ...

Other things could be improved and added. \
Feel free to share your thoughts!

## Install

BCR-GUI is not available in the PlayStore (...yet).

I'll publish it there if its popularity grows but... since **BCR** is a Magisk module, and it requires some skills to be installed, I'm sure that you're also able to download & install a simple APK ðŸ˜‰.

Latest version is [available here](https://github.com/nicorac/bcr-gui/releases/).
